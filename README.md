# SetRelationHandler

This is an expansion of the ComposeRelation program built a few days ago. It contains various set and relation functions that I learned about in my discrete mathematics class. Users can input their own sets and upload relations from a file. From there the user can use the generated relations/sets for further operations. 

ToDo:
-revise I/O buffers to avoid skipping input
-add more set options to menus
